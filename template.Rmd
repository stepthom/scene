```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```


```{r libraries}
library(tidyverse)
library(data.table)
```


## Load the data

```{r}
in_path = '/global/project/queens-mma/scene-csv/sample03/clean/'

# Note: read_csv() is a the preferred way to read in a CSV file in the tidyverse.
# Howewever, fread is 10 times faster. And why should *I* wait?

scene_mbr_dim <-fread(paste(in_path, 'scene_mbr_dim.csv', sep=""), sep=",")
scene_mbr_acct_dim <-fread(paste(in_path, 'scene_mbr_acct_dim.csv', sep=""), sep=",")
scene_pt_fact <-fread(paste(in_path, 'scene_pt_fact.csv', sep=""), sep=",")

# Note: you probably won't need these tables, but in case you do, here they are:
scene_pt_tp_dim <-read_csv(paste(in_path, 'scene_pt_tp_dim.csv', sep=""))
iwd_time <-read_csv(paste(in_path, 'iwd_time.csv', sep=""))
```

Note: the above loads the "small" data set. To load the full dataset instead, change the `in_path` to say "full" instead of `sample03`.

View the first few rows of some of the tables:

```{r}
head(scene_pt_tp_dim, n=10)
head(scene_mbr_dim, n=10)
```


## Analysis

Go forth with your analysis! Use `dplyr` to manipulate the data, `ggplot2` to plot/graph, `rpart` (or similar) for building classifiers, `cluster` for clustering, and all your other training. Good luck, we're all counting on you.
